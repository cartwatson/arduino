# Project goal
[Final Result Video](https://youtu.be/7p7jBCEYopQ)  
The goal of this project was to interface an arduino with a stop light to tell me how far to pull into the garage.  
To fund this project my dad said that he would pay for parts if I could create a prototype.  
V1 and V2 are the two prototypes, V1 was just the ultrasonic sensor and some LEDS on a breadboard, V2 is similar but I simulated a garage with a toy car and cardboard box.  
V3 integrated the relay board that was critical to interacting with the stoplight through the arduino.  
V4 is the final integration that I made changes to as needed after assembling the hardware.
